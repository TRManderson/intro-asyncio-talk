# Intro to Asyncio

This repo contains slides, a setup script, requirements file, and images for the presentation I did at UQCS on 2019-05-28 entitled "Introduction to `asyncio`".

This should not be considered a heavily polished talk, but this Jupyter notebook is presented as a reference for anyone interested. This repo will be updated with a talk recording once the video is uploaded to youtube.

## Setup

1. Create a Python 3 virtualenv with Py3.6 or higher
2. Run the setup script
3. Run `jupyter notebook`
4. You're good to go

The setup script installs dependencies (requests, aiohttp, jupyter notebook, and some notebook extensions - check `requirements.txt`), then configures jupyter to properly install the extensions and enable any required ones.
